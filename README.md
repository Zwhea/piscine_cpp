## About
This project is a micro piscine focused on the C++ programming language. Each `.cpp` file within the project targets a specific programming concept or skill, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Structure
The project is organized into days, with each day dedicated to introducing new C++ concepts. Here's a brief overview of what each day covers:

### Day 00
- [ ] Introduction to C++ basics
- [ ] Structs and classes
- [ ] Conditionals and loops
- [ ] Static usage

### Day 01
- [ ] Memory allocation and deallocation
- [ ] References and pointers
- [ ] Filestream
- [ ] Function pointer and switch case

### Day 02
- [ ] Operator overloading
- [ ] Ad-hoc polymorphism (Function overloading)
- [ ] Canonical classes

### Day 03
- [ ] Inheritance

### Day 04
- [ ] Polymorphism
- [ ] Abstract classes and interfaces

### Day 05
- [ ] Nested classes
- [ ] Exceptions

### Day 06
- [ ] Upcast and downcast
- [ ] Static cast, dynamic cast, reinterpret cast and const cast

### Day 07
- [ ] Templates

### Day 08
- [ ] Standard Template Library

### Day 09
- [ ] Go further with the STL

## Usage
To compile and run each day's exercise, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the day's directory, e.g., `day00/ex00/`.
2. Compile the source files using the provided Makefile:
```
make
```
3. Run the executable to test the program:
```
./executable_name
```

Feel free to explore each day's directory to find the corresponding C++ files and review the code for each concept.
